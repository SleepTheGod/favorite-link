I dream of my relatives, I dream of my best friends, and I dream of her. Everyone is listening to my relatives talking about a person in the garden. They talk about his cuteness as a child, his immaturity in middle school, his rebelliousness in high school, and his maturity in college. Everyone listens silently, while she just smiles silently and implicitly. Relatives face me and talk about the past with laughter. Friends pat my not-too-broad shoulders with laughter. She reaches out and gently strokes my hair that is blown by the breeze. I smile while leaning my hand naturally on her shoulder, touching her cheek, touching her ears and hair. We happily bathe in the afterglow of the sunset and immerse ourselves in the colorful glow. Only I look at the sky and am in a daze. I see a red sun at the junction of red and brown in the distance.
